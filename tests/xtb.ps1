# Builds the tool and launches a private XrmToolBox instance that contains nothing but it.

# XrmToolBox you use for real work: its own Plugins folder, its own settings, its own
# connection list. Delete the folder to undo everything this script did.

#   .\xtb.ps1 -NoLaunch    # set it up without starting XrmToolBox
#
# The connection points at the active organization of the current pac auth profile, which
# is the same environment register.ps1 and verify.ps1 talk to. Pass -Environment <url> to
# aim somewhere else.

# Everything that is XrmToolBox rather than Plugin Step Codegen now lives in the XtbSandbox
# module (github.com/comentality/xrmtoolbox-sandbox), shared with the other tools.
